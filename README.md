# AI_air_polution_prediction
Project discription: part of the AI course project dedicated to build a model for the air pollution prediction at the Paris metro.

Dataset sourse: https://dataratp.opendatasoft.com/explore/?sort=modified

Goal of the research: to create the model for the air pollution prediction.

Team: Yuliia Nikolaenko, Lara-Anna Wagner, Mihaela Grigore.

Project tasks:

1. Predict CO2 level in a selected station from time of day, past values, temperature and
humidity.
2. Predict NO/NO2/PM10 levels in a selected station from past values,
temperature and humidity. Does it help to also consider current CO2 level?
3. Compare models for each stations.
4. Can current levels in two stations help predict levels in third station?
5. Can surface air quality data help predict NO/NO2/PM10/PM25 levels in subway stations?
